## Overview

World News Website is a news aggregator which consumes an external public api generated by The News API service.

## Project Brief and Technical Requirements

* Build a frontend application with React,
* Consumes a public API,
* Have several components,
* The app should include a router,
* It needs to be completed and working within 48 hours.

## Project Execution

### Technologies Used
* HTML5
* SCSS
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Git
* GitHub
* External API
* React
* Webpack
* Bulma
* Node JS
* Babel
* Insomnia

### Approach Taken

#### Planning 

**Find a public API** 
I started by researching a realiable external APIs through different sources such as:
* [ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/), 
* [The Rapid API](https://blog.rapidapi.com/), 
* [Medium](https://medium.com/),
* [The News API](https://newsapi.org)

After researching and using Insomnia to fully understand the data returned by each API I decided to go with the [The News API](https://newsapi.org) because it offers different request routes and a generous requests to API allowance.

**User Stories/Wireframes**
With full understanding of the data available I started drawing the wireframes and the user sitemap/journey on paper. 

**MVP Features**
  * All news index page
  * Detail view for each article
  * Custom search filter
  * Sort by date published and alphabet

**Communication and Action Plan** 
We spent the first couple of hours agreeing how we would work together and keep each other informed of progress. We then listed all the required actions in order to achive MVP and we used Trello to record this. Trello was also handy to keep track of progress. We also spent a few minutes both mornings reviewing what we achieved the day before and what we would work towards in the hours ahead. 

#### Execution 

**Setting-up the project** 

We started the coding process by installing Node JS packs, WebPack and other libraries such as Babel and dotenv to ensure our API key was safe. We also setup Git and GitHub from the outset to track progress and changes during to the project. safe.

**Features Build**

* Custom search option for articles directly in The News API database

```js
componentDidMount() {
    axios.get('https://newsapi.org/v2/everything', {
      params: {
        q: 'world',
        from: this.today(),
        to: this.today(),
        apiKey: process.env.NEWS_API
      }
    })
      .then(res => this.setState({ articles: res.data.articles}))
  }

  getMoreArticles(e) {
    if(e) e.preventDefault()
    axios.get('https://newsapi.org/v2/everything', {
      params: {
        q: this.state.searchTerm || 'world',
        from: this.state.fromDate,
        to: this.today(),
        apiKey: process.env.NEWS_API
      }
    })
      .then(res => this.setState({ articles: res.data.articles}))
  }
```

* Filter and Sort news by alphabet and publish date order

```js
storeSortedValue(e){
    this.setState({ fromDate: e.target.value }, () => {
      this.getMoreArticles()

    })
  }

  storeSortValue(e){
    this.setState({ sortTerm: e.target.value })
  }

  storeSearchValue(e){
    this.setState({ searchTerm: e.target.value })
  }


  filterEngSources() {
    const [field, order] = this.state.sortTerm.split('|')
    const filterSources = this.state.articles
    const sortedSources = _.orderBy(filterSources, [field], [order])
    return sortedSources
  }
  
  ```
  
* See news in either German, Chinese, Italian, Polish and others,

Example of the request:

```js
  componentDidMount() {
    axios.get('https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines', {
      params: {
        country: 'pl',
        apiKey: process.env.NEWS_API
      }
    })
      .then(res => this.setState({ articles: res.data.articles}))
  }
  
  ```

## Wins and Blockers

**Wins**
* Manipulate the API's data to make the most of it,
* Creating filters and sort functionality,
* Building the functionality to search all API's content in the serverside,
* Use of new technologies such as iframe.

**Blockers**
* The API did not offer the full article content, only a snippet of text with the article url. We circonferenced the problem by using an iframe to display the news article. We belived this was a better option than having the user dnavigate away from our website.
