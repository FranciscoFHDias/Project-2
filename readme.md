## Overview

World News Website is a news aggregator which consumes an external public api generated by The News API service.

## Project Brief and Technical Requirements

* Build a frontend application with React,
* Consumes a public API,
* Have several components,
* The app should include a router,
* It needs to be completed and working within 48 hours.

## Project Execution

### Technologies Used
* HTML5
* SCSS
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Git
* GitHub
* External API
* React
* Webpack
* Bulma
* Node JS
* Babel
* Insomnia

### Approach Taken

#### Planning 

> **Find a public API** 
I started by researching a realiable external APIs through different sources such as:
* [ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/), 
* [The Rapid API](https://blog.rapidapi.com/), 
* [Medium](https://medium.com/),
* [The News API](https://newsapi.org)

After researching and using Insomnia to fully understand the data returned by each API I decided to go with the [The News API](https://newsapi.org) because it offers different request routes and a generous requests to API allowance.

> **User Stories/Wireframes**
With full understanding of the data available I started drawing the wireframes and the user sitemap/journey on paper. 

> **MVP Features**
  * All news index page
  * Detail view for each article
  * Custom search filter
  * Sort by date published and alphabet

> **Communication and Action Plan** - We spent the first couple of hours agreeing how we would work together and keep each other informed of progress. We then listed all the required actions in order to achive MVP and we used Trello to record this. Trello was also handy to keep track of progress. We also spent a few minutes both mornings reviewing what we achieved the day before and what we would work towards in the hours ahead. 

#### Execution 

> **Setting-up the project** 
We started the coding process by installing  Node JS packs, WebPack, Express and other other libraries such as Babel. We also setup Git and GitHub from the outset to track progress and changes during the project.
dotenv to ensure our API key was safe.

## Features 
The World News Website offers:

* World News which will allow the user to:
   * Custom search option for articles directly in The News API database
   * Sort news by alphabet and publish date order
   * Extend search to last 48hours/Week/Month from the 24hrs which is display initially
   
* Local Headlines which will allow the user to:
   * See news in either German, Chinese, Italian, Polish and xxxx
   * Extend search to last 48hours/Week/Month from the 24hrs which is display initially.
   
World News Website was co-authored between two  General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive students.

## Wins and Blockers

### Wins
The API was very limited and patchy on the offered 10 properties:
* source
* id
* name
* authored
* title
* description
* url
* urlToImage
* publishedAt
* content

We decided to expand on the publishedAt key in order to create functions that let you filter by time, up to one month ago. This was a fun challenge and allowed us to play around with Javascripts in-built new Date function.

### Blockers
The API we chose had a lot of objects to work with but was very patchy. Most of the articles were missing unique ids. To get around this we used the objects url as a unique identifier for our project.
The API was also lacking in the full article content, and offered only a snippet of text with the article url. As we did not want the user to navigate away from our website, we used an iframe to display the news article on show. This meant we could retain the news articles visual identity on our website as well. In an ideal world, the API would have had enough information for us to avoid using the iframe.
